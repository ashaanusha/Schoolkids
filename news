Janhvi will play the lead role in producer Dinesh Vijan’s next titled Rooh-Afza.The movie also stars Rajkummar Rao and Varun Sharma.AdvertisingIn Rooh-Afza, Janhvi will be seen playing two characters Roohi and Afsana and we are guessing this is going to be a double role. The double-role trope was quite popular in Hindi films until the 90s though not many have attempted it since. Sridevi’s performance in Chaalbaaz is still remembered by her fans and Janhvi will surely have big shoes to fill",
